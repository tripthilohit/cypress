### Document any thoughts you have on the project's tests, especially if you see any test gaps. What kinds of testing should be done on this project?

Types of testing that should be done on this project are functionality testing, API testing, Cross browser/device testing and probably load testing too.

### Document any manual tests you have done, or would like to do.

Test case 1 - Verify if the feature design matches with the design spec(Design-Spec-Main.png).

Test case 2 - Verify if the user can add a new message and the post shows up on the UI on submission.

Test 3 - Refresh the page and verify to see if the data did not persist. According to the spec document (Spec.md) there is no need to persist the data.

Test case 4 - Verify if hovering(on Desktop)/tapping(on Mobile) over the post, transitions the post into the alternative view. 
Note: Should match the design in Design-Spec-Click.png.

Test case 5 - Verify if the post displays date, time and userâ€™s avatar.

Test case 6 - Verify if validation message is displayed when empty message is posted.

Test case 7 - Verify if the number of characters a post can take is 140 or less and not more than that.

Test case 8 - Cross browser/device testing on 
Mac - Safari, Firefox and Chrome
Windows - Edge, Firefox and Chrome
iPhone - Safari, Chrome
Android - Firefox, Chrome


### Extend the existing tests, or add on a few new [selenium/cypress/tool of choice] tests. It's ok to choose a language that is not javascript and attach a separate zip. Choose anything you are comfortable with.

Tool used for automated tests is Cypress.
Please see tests under folder ../Cypress/cypress/integration/better
